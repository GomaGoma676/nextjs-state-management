Nowadays it's already main stream that React state management is splitted to "Server data state management" and "Client(UI) state management". In Nextjs, we can use useSWR for "Server data state management" as we can access cached data from any components or pages. For the "Client(UI) state management", in light weight application we can use "Jotai"/super light weight bundle size 2.5kB/v0.16.6 in stead of useContext. Jotai has advantage in terms of less code (no custom provider file), no counter measure needed for re-rendering (we face this issue in useContext), and super light weight bundle size over the useContext.
